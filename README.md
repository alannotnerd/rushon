#[RUSHON]

Tools to launch binaries in local machine.

## Why this tool?
It's common to launch multiple components with different environment variables. But sometimes it's really slow to make docker images and run docker-compose especially when you are developing the component. This tool is for launching binaries in local machine with different environment variables.

## Usage

```bash
rushon {config}.toml
```
